Q1: What is the unit of force? Define it.
- The SI unit of force is Newton (N). Definition: Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kilogram by 1 metre per second squared (1 m/s²). Therefore, 1 N = 1 kg·m/s².
   - Right

Q2: State Newton’s third law of motion.
- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first body.
   - Right

Q3: What is the difference between speed and velocity?
- Speed is a scalar quantity representing how fast an object moves (magnitude only). Velocity is a vector quantity representing rate of change of displacement, i.e., it has both magnitude and direction.
   - Right
