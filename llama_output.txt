Q1: Simplify: 3x + 4x - 5 + 7
=> 3x + 4x = 7x
=> -5 + 7 = 2
=> 7x + 2
[Right] The student correctly combined like terms and simplified the expression.

Q2: Solve x = 2x + 3 = 11
2x + 3 = 11
2x = 8
2x / 2 = 8 / 2
=> x = 4
[Right] The student correctly solved for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.

Q3: Area = πr²
r = 7
=> 3.14 x 6 x 6
=> 167.3
[Wrong, but partially correct] The student used the correct formula for the area of a circle (A = πr²) and the correct radius (r = 7), but made an error in calculating the area (should be 153.86 cm²).

Q4: Define Pythagoras theorem.
Pythagorean is shit
[Wrong] The student did not provide a definition for Pythagoras' theorem, instead providing an unrelated statement.

Q5: Evaluate (5² + 3²) / 4
=> 5² = 25
=> 3² = 9
=> Sum = 34
3² + 4 = 8.5
[Wrong] The student made an error in the final step by adding 3² and 4 instead of dividing the sum by 4.

Q6: Meriyadhu
[Missing answer] This question is not present in the provided list of questions, so it's unclear what the student was asked to do.
