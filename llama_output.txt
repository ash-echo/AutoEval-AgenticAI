Q1: Simplify: 3x + 4x - 5 + 7
=> 3x + 4x = 7x
=> -5 + 7 = 2
=> 7x + 2
[Right]

Q2: Solve x = 2x + 3 = 11
2x + 3 = 11
2x = 8
2x / 2 = 8 / 2
=> x = 4
[Right]

Q3: Area = πr²
r = 7
=> 3.14 x 6 x 6
=> 167.3
[Wrong, the area should be 153.86 cm²]

Q4: Define Pythagoras theorem.
Pythagorean is shit
[Wrong, the answer should define Pythagoras theorem as In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides]

Q5: Evaluate (5² + 3²) / 4
=> 5² = 25
=> 3² = 9
=> Sum = 34
3² + 4 = 8.5
[Wrong, the correct answer is 8.5]
