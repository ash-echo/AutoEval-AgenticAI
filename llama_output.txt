Q1: What is the unit of force? Define it. - The SI unit of force is Newton (N). Definition: Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kilogram by 1 metre per second squared (1 m/s²). Therefore, 1 N = 1 kg·m/s². [Right]

Q2: State Newton’s third law of motion. - Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. [Right]

Q3: What is the difference between speed and velocity? - Speed is a scalar quantity representing how fast an object moves (magnitude only). Velocity is a vector quantity representing rate of change of displacement, i.e., it has both magnitude and direction. [Right]
